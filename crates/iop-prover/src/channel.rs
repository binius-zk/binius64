//! Channel abstraction for interactive oracle protocol (IOP) provers.
//!
//! An IOP extends the public-coin interactive protocol model with oracle access: the prover can
//! commit to oracles (e.g., Merkle trees) that the verifier can query at specific positions. This
//! module provides the [`IOPProverChannel`] trait that models the prover's view of such an
//! interaction.
//!
//! The trait extends [`IPProverChannel`] with additional methods for:
//! - Committing oracles to the verifier
//! - Responding to oracle queries with opening proofs
//!
//! This abstraction allows protocol implementations to be generic over the underlying
//! communication and commitment mechanisms.

/// Channel for IOP provers that extends the IP prover channel with oracle operations.
///
/// In an IOP, the prover can:
/// 1. Send field elements to the verifier via `send_*` methods (inherited)
/// 2. Sample random challenges via `sample` (inherited)
/// 3. Commit oracles to the verifier
/// 4. Respond to oracle queries with opening proofs
///
/// # Contract
///
/// The caller must call `send_oracle()` exactly `remaining_oracle_specs().len()` times before
/// calling `finish()`. Each oracle buffer must match the corresponding specification.

	/// * All oracle handles in `oracle_relations` must be valid handles returned by
	///   `send_oracle()`.
